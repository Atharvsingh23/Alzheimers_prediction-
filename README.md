🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Model

A machine learning-powered web application to predict Alzheimer’s disease risk based on patient health data and cognitive test results.
Built with Python, multiple ML algorithms, and Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

✨ Features

🧪 Symptom-Based Prediction – Input patient data and cognitive scores to get disease risk

🤖 Multiple ML Algorithms – Compare predictions from Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and more

📊 Performance Metrics – Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score visualizations for each model

🌐 Interactive UI – Streamlit dashboard for easy input and prediction

🔄 Real-Time Feedback – Instant prediction results on submitting patient data

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizations to understand feature importance
